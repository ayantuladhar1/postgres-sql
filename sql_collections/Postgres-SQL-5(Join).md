# SQL-5-(JOIN)
* JOIN
* A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
* Different Types of JOINS in PostgresSQL:
* 1. INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
* 2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and match records from the right table.
  3. RIGHT JOIN: Retuens all records from right table, and match records from the left table.
  4. FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
